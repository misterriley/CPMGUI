<i>CPMGUI</i> v0.1<br>
GUI and integration by Steven Riley, CPM Code by Fengdan Ye<br>
Published 10/2022<br>
<br>
1. Introduction<br>
<i>CPMGUI</i> is a graphical user interface for Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling. It is written in Python and uses the
<i>PyQt5</i> library for GUI elements. It is designed to be a simple and easy to use interface for the CPM code. It is not
designed to be a replacement for the CPM code, but rather a tool to make it easier to use.<br>
<br>
2. Installation<br>
<i>CPMGUI</i> is written in Python and uses the <i>PyQt5</i> library. Installation is performed by <i>PyInstaller</i>.
If you're reading this then you already have it installed.<br>
<br>
3. Usage<br>
<i>CPMGUI</i> is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is split into four main sections, which are displayed in tabs.
The first tab is the "Input" tab. This is where you input where the data comes from. The second tab is the "Parameters"
tab. This is where the parameters that determine runtime behavior are set. The third tab is the "Output" tab. This is
where you set the location of the created output tabs. The fourth tab is the "Run" tab. This is where you check the
settings and run the code.<br>
<br>
3.1 Input<br>
The input tab is where you set the location of the input data. There are three sections: "Connectivity Matrices",
"Behavioral Data", and "Subject Key".<br>
<br>
3.1.1 Connectivity Matrices<br>
The connectivity matrices section is where you set the location of the connectivity matrices. A file is required to run CPM.
You can use the "Browse" button to select the file. The file must have the .mat suffix and be a matlab file.
The file must contain a list of square matrices of dimension <i>v</i> x <i>v</i> x <i>n</i>, where <i>v</i> is the
number of vertices and <i>n</i> is the number of subjects. If there is only one variable in the file, then this variable
will be assumed to be the connectivity matrices. If there are multiple variables, then set the name of the variable
containing the connectivity matrices in the "Connectivity Matrices Variable Name" box.<br>
<br>
3.1.2 Behavioral Data<br>
The behavioral data section is where you set the location of the behavioral data. A file is optional. If you do not
specify a file, it will be assumed that the Connectivity Matrices File also contains the behavioral data of interest. In
this case, specify the name of the behavioral variable in the "Behavioral Data Variable Name" box. If you do specify a
file containing the behavioral data, then the file may either be a .mat file, a .xlsx file, or a csv file with suffix .csv or .txt. If
there is only one variable in this file, then this variable will be assumed to be the behavioral data. If there are
multiple variables, then set the name of the variable containing the behavioral data in the "Behavioral Data Variable Name"
box. CSV FILES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE HEADERS. IF THERE IS AN OFF-BY-ONE ERROR THIS IS PROBABLY THE CAUSE. CHANGING THE
SUFFIX TO .TXT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.<br>
<br>
3.1.3 Subject Key<br>
The subject key section is where you set the location of the subject key. A file is optional. If you do not specify a file,
it will be assumed that the Connectivity Matrices File also contains the subject key. In this case, specify the name of the
subject key variable in the "Subject Key Variable Name" box. If you do specify a file containing the subject key, then the
file may either be a .mat file, a .xlsx file, or a csv file with suffix .csv or .txt. If there is only one variable in this file, then this
variable will be assumed to be the subject key. If there are multiple variables, then set the name of the variable containing
the subject key in the "Subject Key Variable Name" box.<br>
<br>
3.2 Parameters<br>
The parameters tab is where you set the parameters that determine runtime behavior. All fields must be set to a valid
value. If a field is not set to a valid value, then the code will not run. The parameters are as follows:<br>
<br>
* Time index: The time index of the connectivity matrices to use. This must be an integer between 1 and n, where n is the
number of time points in the connectivity matrices. If there is only one time point of interest in the connectivity
matrices file, then this parameter is not used.<br>
* K Folds: The number of folds to use in cross validation. This must be an integer between 1 and n, where n is the number
of subjects.<br>
* P Threshold: The threshold for detecting significant edges. This must be a float between 0 and 1. Typically, 0.05 or 0.01
is used.<br>
* Repeats: The number of times to repeat the cross validation with different random seeds on the raw data. This must be an
integer.<br>
* Permuted Repeats: The number of times to repeat the cross validation with different random seeds on the permuted data.
* Permuted data reassigns the behavioral data to the subjects randomly. This must be an integer.<br>
* Z-score: Whether to apply a Fisher z-score transformation to the connectivity matrices. If checked, then the
connectivity matrices will be transformed. If not checked, then the connectivity matrices will not be transformed.<br>
* Mode: The mode to use for the CPM code. If "linear" is selected, then the CPM code will use linear regression. If "ridge" is
selected, then the CPM code will use ridge regression. If "logistic" is selected, then the CPM code will use logistic
regression (for binary data). WARNING: "logistic" mode is not yet implemented.<br>
* Jobs: The number of jobs to use for parallel processing. This must be a positive integer. It is suggested to use a
value between 1 and half the number of cores on your computer. It defaults to x/3, where x is the number of cores.
If you set this to 1, then the code will not use parallel processing. If you set this to a value greater than 1, then
the code will use parallel processing. If you set this to a value equal to or greater than the number of cores, then the code will
likely freeze your computer.<br>
<br>
3.3 Output<br>
The output tab is where you set the location of the output. Select the location of the parent folder where the output
folder should be created. The output folder will be created in the parent folder with a procedurally generated name that
indicates the date, number of folds, threshold, repeats, permuted repeats, timepoint, z-score, mode, and originating
connectivity matrices file.<br>
<br>
3.4 Run<br>
The run tab is where you check the settings and run the code. The settings are displayed in a table once the "Run"
button is pressed. If the settings are correct, then press the "Ok" button to run the code. If the settings are not correct,
then press the "Cancel" button to return to the other tabs. When the code is running, the "Run" button will be replaced
with a button titled "Running..." and will be disabled. When the code is finished running, the "Running..." button will
be replaced with a button titled "Run" and will be enabled. While running, the <i>CPMGUI</i> will not be responsive.<br>
<br>
4. Logs<br>
<i>CPMGUI</i> will create a log file for every run. The log file will be created in the logs folder under the directory from
which <i>CPMGUI</i> was run. The log file will be named with the time of the run. The log file will output any information
that is printed to the console. This includes information about the run, warnings, and errors. The log file will also
display any unexpected errors that were not caught by the code. If you encounter an error, please send the log file
to the author, steven.riley@yale.edu.<br>
